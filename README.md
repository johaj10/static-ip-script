# Static IP Script
This is a simple shell script that sets a static IP address on an Ubuntu Server system. 

## To Use:
Run these commands:
```bash
chmod +x netsetup.sh
```
```bash
./netsetup.sh
```
Make sure you enter a **static IP address that is supported and available (not being used) on your network**! This script sets the DNS server to 8.8.8.8 which is Google DNS. Enjoy!
